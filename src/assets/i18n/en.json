        "everyday": "“Every day doctors all over the world capture only a small portion of the data they see, but only a little bit of this information is captured. Imagine how much we could do if we could make it easy for doctors to capture that data while they are talking with the patient, on a tablet and convert it into useful information. They could follow up with clients much more easily, make sure clients come back for follow up appointments and offer better care. We have to learn to use the power of information technology to improve care at the community level!”",
        "founded": "CloudDoctor, founded by Dr. Ton van der Velden MD MPH, was built to help doctors in middle income countries capture and store the medical data they collect from their clients and convert it into information that can help them provide better care.
